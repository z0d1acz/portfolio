## ðŸŽ¯ About this repo
This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages. My goal is to:
- publish clear, *sanitized* walkthroughs,
- explain the root cause and remediation,
- provide minimal PoC code thatâ€™s safe to reuse for learning (no live credentials or flags included).
