# Hi â€” I'm **z0diacz** ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my HackTheBox writeups and security labs.  
I document exploit chains, lessons learned, and sanitized PoCs so others can learn the same techniques I used responsibly and ethically.

## About me
I'm a security enthusiast who enjoys web security, exploitation chains, and writing clear, actionable writeups. My preferred tools include: `nmap`, `Burp Suite`, `python`, and `john`.  
I focus on responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and learning defensively, documenting both the exploit and the fix.

All technical writeups are stored in this repository under `/ _posts /` (Markdown). If you'd like the raw artifacts or scripts for a writeup, open an issue or contact me on LinkedIn/GitHub.
